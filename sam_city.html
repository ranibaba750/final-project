              <p>I began supporting Manchester City Football Club during the 2012-13 season. At the time, Yaya Toure was playing and I really enjoyed watching him. His playstyle really enticed me to keep watching Man City every weekend. Ever since then, I have been loyal to the club as it has been the only soccer club I have supported in my life.</p>

              <p>My favorite Man City season is the 2020-21 season. In this season, we won the Premier League and EFL Cup, came second place in the Champions League, and reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup. We also had a 28 game unbeaten streak in all competitions with including 21 straight wins. My favorite wins came against Paris Saint-Germain in the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League where we won 4-1 on aggregate.</p>
