              <p>I began supporting the Detroit Pistons ever since I was a little kid. Growing up in Michigan meant that I had to root for the local team, which is the primary reason why I am a Pistons fan.</p>

              <p>My favorite Pistons season is the 2015-16 season. Unfortunately, the team has not been good throughout my time as a supporter, with exception to the years prior to 2008, where I was too young to understand the sport. This season remains one of our only seasons where we made the playoffs in the last decade. We ended up losing in the first round to the Cleveland Cavaliers.</p>

              <p>My favorite Pistons team is actually the current 2022-23 team. Although we are not winning a lot of games right now, we have a lot of young talent that will help lead us in the future. This young core includes Cade Cunningham, Jaden Ivey, Isaiah Stewart, Jalen Duren, and Saddiq Bey.</p>

              <p>Throughout the years, the Pistons have had some really nice jerseys. I prefer the jerseys from the 1990s, but the ones that came before and followed are nice too. Some of my favorites are the 1980s away, 1990s away, 1990s alternate, 2000s alternate, 2020s alternate, and 2022 alternate. </p>

              <p>My favorite Pistons player is Tayshaun Prince. Prince played for the Pistons from 2002-2013. As the starting small forward for many years, he was crucial in helping the Pistons win the 2004 NBA Championship. I really enjoy watching great defenders play, which led him to becoming my favorite Pistons player.</p>
